# Crowdfunding_ETL
The main code for the project is located in the ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_TBagley_ERobinson_KConlon.ipynb file. This pulls data from the Resources folder in the Starter_Files folder. It also exports data to that same folder. For this code Option 1 was used on the assignment.
There is also a schema file for postgresql. This file is called crowdfunding_db_schema.sql. This creates a schema for the four csv files created in the main code. The folder pictures of sql querys shows pictures as evidence that the data was loaded into the crowdfunding_db properly. 
The Starter_Files folder also contains some starter code that was given to us for the project.
ERD Diagram of the table schema is also included in ERD Diagram.png file
